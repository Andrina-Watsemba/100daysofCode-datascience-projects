#  100 Days of code

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode  repository!  
This repo documents my journey of consistent learning and practice in *Data Science and Analytics specifically in python* â€” one dataset, one concept, one day at a time.

The goal of this project is to:
- Strengthen my data analysis and storytelling skills.  
- Explore real-world datasets and apply Python tools for cleaning, visualization, and modeling.  
- Build a public portfolio of my learning progress and insights.
